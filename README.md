## Introduction

DataDAO for DeSci Projects build on top of FVM. DataDAOs are DAOs whose mission revolves around the preservation, curation, augmentation, and promotion of datasets considered valuable by their stakeholders.
Decentralized Science [through DataDAOs]
DataDAOs can be used to store open access papers and journals. They can store (as proofs) the results of reproducible experiments and provide incentives for scientists to upload new papers over time. They can raise funds for research that are unorthodox or come from a unique source.

Can the peer review process be made more fair (perhaps through quadratic voting)?

How can scientific code be made reproducible? Often these are written as one-off scripts and can be hard to recreate, even for famous publications.

We also need to enable massive scale data science on the data collected on these papers. We can make metadata analysis really easy because the data collected in a DeSci DAO can be analyzed and imputed on in a straightforward manner.

## Web 3.0 technologies Used

Web3 technologies: IPFS/filecoin (W3UI), Livepeer (livepeer.js), Web3Modal, XMTP, NFT Port, ENS, Lit Protocol, Polygon, Graph, Lens, Huddle01  
Backend: Solidity, Node.js

Blockchain deployed to:  Polygon POS Mumbai Testnet

## Description

              A decentralized Science (DeSci) Peer Review DataDAO for Publishing scientific papers and the results of their reproducible experiments (Artifacts) while providing incentives for scientists to upload new papers over time. Papers and artifacts are stored as open access and journals. They can store (as proofs) various artifacts from their experiment. DAO members can raise funds for research that are unorthodox or come from a unique source. Artificats are stored on Filecoin using Filecoin's service provider (SP) data deals and they are also rewarded.

The smart contract uses ERC-721 specification to hold metadata URI for papers published, The DataDAO contract for SP reward was also developed. DAO members vote for reserach work that would be includeded into the artifcats repository. ethers.js was used to interact with the smart contract. The contract was deployed to Hyperspace Teatnet on Filecoin EVM blockchain. The entire project demo was hosted on Spheron and Vercel.
